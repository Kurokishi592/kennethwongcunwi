## Overview

(Write-up in progress.)

## What I’m building

- Power distribution and protection
- Sensor/actuator interfacing
- Harnessing, integration, and bring-up

## Notes

If you add a dedicated AUV5.0 thumbnail under `public/assets` (ideally a `*-main.*` image), update `thumbnail:` above to point to it.
