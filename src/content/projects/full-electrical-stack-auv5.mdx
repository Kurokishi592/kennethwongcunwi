## Overview

AUV 5.0 is the newest iteration of [Bumblebee](https://bumblebee.sg/)'s Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to increase our AUV's capabilities and efficiency in completing task for competitions. This is also a follow up from the [MiniAUV project](/projects/mini-auv-robosub-2025/) that we developed for [Robosub 2025](https://bumblebee.sg/competitions/robosub/2025/), where we tested new sensors, peripherals and thruster configurations.

I am currently working with my team on AUV 5.0's full electrical stack to upgrade the overall power and communications architecture significantly.

## What we are working on:

- Power distribution and protection
- VESC, Sensors, Actuators, Compute Stack interfacing
- Firmware for all MCUs on the various PCBs 
- Communications
- Integration, and bring-up

>[!warning] You will need to wait for a while for the full writeup!
> Well, the developments are exciting and so is reveal of this project's performance during the competition itself!
