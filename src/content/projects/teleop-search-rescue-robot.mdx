## Overview

The robot is designed to be teleoperated by users using a keyboard in a separate room. Users are to perceive the robot's environment using sensors and real-time mapping to search for two astronauts, delivering a care package to one and bringing the other to the safe zone, as fast as possible.
• Integrated LiDAR, SLAM, RPi Camera and HC-SR04 for autonomous mapping and obstacle detection
• Integrated BNO-085 IMU sensor for yaw/heading estimates, to turn accurately
• Developed low-level firmware using bare-metal programming on Arduino Mega
• Implemented TLS encryption for secure remote operation

This project fulfils the requirements of the final project for CG2111A: Engineering Principle and Practice II.
