## Overview

This was my core memory of high school robotics.

It was also where all my mechanical skills were honed to their sharpest. 

Mechanisms such as scissors lift, reverse-4-bar lifting mechanism, flywheels, pistons, etc. were experimented and used in various iterations of VEX robots.

We also program in a C++ based environment during the autonomous period of the matches.

>[!info] VEX robots uses their proprietary system of VEX Cortex and the newer V5 system. This robotics domain involves designing effective mechanisms to compete in a 2v2 remote controlled field element point-based competition.

## The journey
>[!danger] This project has too many details, and I am still in the process of recollecting them :) More details will be added soon!

## Our achievements
After four years of failures and losses, the year 2020 marked our breakthrough in VEX Robotics competitions:
- Tournament Champions - Singapore VEX Robotics Competition National Championships (2020)
- Represented Singapore on international grounds in VEX Robotics World Championship 2020 (High School Division)

The hardwork and countless hours of designing, building, and testing our robots finally paid off.

It is not an exaggeration to say that this was one of the most memorable and defining moments of my high school robotics journey.

## Some photos! (For now)
